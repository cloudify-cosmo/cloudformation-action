Creates an AWS CloudFormation environment.

# Environment Variables

This Action uses the Cloudify Profile environment variables described in the official
Cloudify documentation (see [More Information](#more-information) below).

In addition, the following environment variables are used:

| Name | Description
| -----|------------
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key ID to use for AWS access
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key to use for AWS access
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region to use for the stack; if not specified, then the value of the `aws_region_name` Cloudify secret is used

# Inputs

(Certain commonly-used inputs are documented in our official website; see [More Information](#more-information) below)

| Name | Description
|------|------------
| `stack-name` | CloudFormation's stack name
| `template-file` | Path to the file containing the template
| `bucket-name` | Name of S3 bucket to get the template from; if specified, then `resource_name` must also be specified
| `resource-name` | Name of file, within the bucket specified by `bucket_name`, containing the template to be used
| `template-url` | URL of CloudFormation template
| `parameters-file` | YAML/JSON file containing template parameters
| `outputs-file` | Path to JSON file to receive the Cloudify environment's outputs and capabilities

## Notes

* The template must be specified by exactly one of the following ways:
  * `template-file`, pointing to a file on the pipeline's workspace
  * Combination of `bucket-name` and `resource-name`, denoting an S3 bucket name and the path to
    a file within that bucket, respectively. The resource within the bucket must be publicly available.
  * `template-url`, which must be a URL to a resource hosted on S3, and accessible by the credentials
     provided to the pipeline.

# Example

```yaml
jobs:
  test_job:
    env:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create environment
        uses: cloudify-cosmo/cloudformation-action@v1.1
        with:
          environment-name: "test-cfn-$GITHUB_RUN_ID"
          labels: some_label:label_value,yet_another_label:some_value
          stack-name: "githubcfnstack-$GITHUB_RUN_ID"
          template-file: cfn/stack.yaml
          parameters-file: cfn/test-params/integration.yaml
          outputs-file: env-data.json
```

Note how the AWS credentials are set as environment variables, with the values being taken
from GitHub secrets.

The template file and parameters file are both taken from the repository that was checked out
during the "Checkout code" step.
